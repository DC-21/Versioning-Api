# Versioning-Api

The aim of this project is to develop a webapi to stimulate Versioning of APIs.

Install following packages:
dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Versioning
dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Versioning.ApiExplorer

For database i will use postgresql so install the driver:
dotnet add package Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL

Its advisable to use VS Code for this project because we are going to need a GUI for our database,
so install a PostgreSQL extension and configure the connection.
